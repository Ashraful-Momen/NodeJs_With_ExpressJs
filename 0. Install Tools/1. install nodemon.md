To **automatically restart your Node.js/Express app when code changes** (without manual reloading), you can use **`nodemon`** — a popular development utility that watches for file changes and restarts the server automatically.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

#### 1. **Install `nodemon` globally (or locally)**
On your server (`instasure-dns-vm-06`), run:

```bash
# Option A: Install globally (recommended for dev environments)
npm install -g nodemon

# OR Option B: Install as a dev dependency in your project
cd ~/gitlab_project/digitalCard-dockerized
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

> 💡 Since this appears to be a **development or staging environment**, using `nodemon` is appropriate.  
> ⚠️ **Do NOT use `nodemon` in production** — use `pm2` or a process manager instead.

---

#### 2. **Update Your Start Command**

Instead of:
```bash
node app.js
```

Use:
```bash
# If installed globally
nodemon app.js

# If installed locally
npx nodemon app.js
```

> ✅ `nodemon` will watch `.js`, `.json`, `.ts`, etc. files by default and restart the server on change.

---

#### 3. **(Optional) Create a `nodemon.json` config file**
In your project root (`~/gitlab_project/digitalCard-dockerized`), create:

```json
{
  "watch": ["."],
  "ext": "js,json",
  "ignore": ["node_modules/", ".git/", "logs/"],
  "exec": "node app.js"
}
```

Then simply run:
```bash
nodemon
```

---

#### 4. **Bonus: Auto-restart in Docker (if applicable)**
Since your project is named `digitalCard-dockerized`, if you're using **Docker for development**, you can also:

- Use a **bind mount** to sync host code into the container
- Run `nodemon` **inside** the container

Example `Dockerfile` dev snippet:
```Dockerfile
# Install nodemon in dev image
RUN npm install -g nodemon
CMD ["nodemon", "app.js"]
```

And run with volume mount:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 3000:3000 your-image
```

---

### 🚫 Important: Not for Production!
- `nodemon` is a **development tool**.
- In production, use:
  - **`pm2`**: `pm2 start app.js --watch` (with caution)
  - Or better: **rebuild & redeploy** via CI/CD (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, etc.)
  - Or use **Docker with rolling updates**

But for your current workflow (manual `node app.js`), **`nodemon` is the perfect fix**.

---

### ▶️ Quick Test
```bash
cd ~/gitlab_project/digitalCard-dockerized
nodemon app.js
```

Now edit `app.js` (e.g., change the welcome message) → save → you’ll see:
```
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
```
And the server reloads automatically! 🔄

Let me know if you want help setting up **production-grade auto-reload with PM2** or **Docker + nodemon dev setup**!
